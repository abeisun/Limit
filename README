Many college campuses have dangerous drinking culture 
that can lead young and unexperienced drinkers into 
the possibility of the overdose. At Whack 2017, We
created a mobile application dubbed ////Limit//////.

The objectives of Limit is to learn a user's tolerance
to alcohol and also contact a family member or friend
if the user's BAC is calculated to be harmfully high
and send a text message to their prefered contact.

Our team utilized Android Studio to create the project.
For the majority of us, this was our first time with
the program.

Naturally, we ran into a few challenges. A few include:
1. Consolidating ideas and refining a mutual goal to complete.
2. Employing a new set of tools to accomplish said goal.
3. Honoing in to compile the project and merge each piece
   together to demo at the end of the scheduled hack period.

We're proud to make something new that can keep people safe!
Hopefully, the app's service helps many user's learn about
safe drinking habits and assist others in riskier situations.

What's next for Limit?
We hope to predicte when the user reached their alcohol 
consumption limit and warn them when they are hitting
the danger zone and allow future suggestions in habit.
